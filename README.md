# Zephyr
 Zephyr is an app that can wirelessly transfer and run local websites from a Mac to an iPhone (or other iOS device) for easy mobile testing. Once transferred, websites are fully native and support relative paths, JavaScript, etc.

 ## Note: Temporary Source Removal
  Source code was recently removed due to an in-progress switch from SwiftUI to UIKit and WKWebView. Code will be republished soon!
